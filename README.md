## Translations

This repo contains the translations of MCdle. I will keep english and german up to date, everything else is community based, so feel free to contribute! Pull requests are welcome, for new languages, fixes or updates!

### Language modifications

I will try to mark commits that change the language files with a 🌍 emoji, so you can easily see if there are any changes to the language files. The 🖼️ emoji means that there are new images. Currently images do not have translations, but there might be translation options in the future.
